# Reflection

This article discusses the newest AI chatbot that has been making headlines worldwide - DeepSeek. It discusses that it was created in China, and that the most shocking part is the limited budget used to create it while still having a quality product. I think that this extends itself to all of the software industry since many projects are very expensive to make when it may be possible to significantly reduce costs. I think it will be interesting to see how DeepSeek continues to evolve and how other companies such as OpenAI react or improve their products in order to keep up.

I found it interesting how you mention that DeepSeek was made with a limited budget. I find the idea of creating a ChatGPT competitor intimidating while having a limited budget, or having other hard constraints.
